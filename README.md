# adblock-filter-analyzer
JavaScript library that analyzes AdBlock Filter Syntax. Colorizes and explains the syntax. Good for learning.

Live version located at https://www.reddragonwebdesign.com/projects/AdBlock%20Filter%20Analyzer/

I made this because I was teaching myself AdBlock filter language, and I had trouble finding a tool that diced the filters into their basic parts and explained what they were.

## Tests

This project is a perfect fit for Test Driven Development.

I've written a list of tests that should always pass, and a list of tests that should always fail. I frequently plug these test lists into my filter, look for errors, and improve the code.

I've got plenty of "should always pass" lists from the AdBlock filter lists floating around out there. But I am very interested in "should always fail" tests. Feel free to create issues or pull requests and submit additional fail tests.
